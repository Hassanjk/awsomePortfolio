						<h3 id="change_h3_text_pos">It was Early in the morning, took my breakfast as usual, 
							later head to school, i looked at the class first seat and saw you, at the time,i really had no clue with who you were, 
							though your eyes seemed curious about everything,to be honest, 
							by then my plan was to make freinds as much as possible so that i can learn from whatever new stuff they knew, 
							i really didn't want to miss out any update regarding technology for i had engaged myself to learn many things during high-school,
							the plan worked as imagined,i made freinds from different continets with totally different beliefs, life prespective and culture,
							it was easy for me to tolerate any situation because my former high-school was an international.(About you)</h3>

						<h1 id="change_top_header">“The unique you...”</h1>
						<h3 id="change_h3_text_posc">There was aday i saw you coming from the Masjid,that's what really inspired me more to know about you, 
							i have wanted to talk to you since then but coulden't find the right time,so petiently i was waiting, After some days i decided to talk with you about the LearnBasicDeen project, the reason i came to you was  because i believe 
							you were and are capable of contributing more..,you were the first person to help me out with the project without any excuses,In short you trusted me,I really appreciated that,
							 after that moment i wanted to help you as much as i could, that was because every minute after you joined the project gave me motivation, I really appreciated that as well,step by step we got close to each other.., 
							at first i thought i was  helping you because you helped me, but i later realized that i helped you because i do love you.(i really apreciate it.)</h3>

						<h1  id="change_top_header">“Confession...”</h1>
						<h3 id="change_h3_text_posd">I have feelings for you,and to be honest with you the more i try to ignore them, 
							the more they develop,i felt happy every time you texted me + those emoji's really brought hapiness as well, i have never been a victim of love before, but this time i guess am one of the victims, i have created many projects i wanted to do with you but,
							 i couldn't continue because i need your permission,for example i once wrote on telegram and asked you about, your favourite food,color,flower extra..,but i 
							 later realized that it wasn't right to ask such things from you, i felt like i was doing a mistake, thus why i deleted them all.(glad you dont use telegram alot &#x1F600;)
							 Though i have learnt that "I can make someone love me, but i can't make someone choose me.",that is the reason why i have always wanted  to meet with you,
							to know what is my position in your heart.whatever your answers is, trust me i do respect it,am telling you this so that i don't make mistakes wich will make you angry or sad,
							in the future,i always want to see you happy,next slide has projects and a video, if you feel like we can talk  on phone, i will be waiting,
							if you can't then the next slide is having message link, you can click that as well and send you message regarding the questions wich will be provided,
							Thank you for building a better version of me, I really appreciate it.
